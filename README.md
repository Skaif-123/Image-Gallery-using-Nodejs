**Working Of Image Gallery App**
This is Image gallery app where user can upload images by using drag drop functionality or directly uploading from system files.In this case we have uploaded image.I have used Cloudinary and multer for image uploading and extracting from cloud directly.We have developed API for connecting to MongoDB,Multer and Cloudinary. Axios and Cors package have been used for connection of frontend and backend.For drag and drop functionality I have use react-dropzone and react-router-dom for navigating between pages.react-toastify library of react has been used creating toast.React Icons have also been used in this project.
**Features**
1. upload multiple images/gif files
2. drag-drop functionality
3. used multer for local storage which can be used for using file function of javascript
4. image uploaded to cloud platform like cloudinary and data of image is stored on mongoDB which   makes it easier for further enhancement of CRUD operations.
